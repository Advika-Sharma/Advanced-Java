### What is J2EE?

Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) is a platform for developing and deploying multi-tier enterprise applications. It provides a robust, scalable, and secure environment for building server-side applications using Java technology, addressing the need for efficient solutions in information management.

### J2EE Architecture

J2EE employs a multi-tier architecture, which typically includes the following tiers:

1. **Client Tier**:
   - This tier comprises web components like Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP) or standalone Java applications.
   - It provides dynamic user interfaces that interact with the middle tier.

2. **Middle Tier** (Server Tier):
   - It contains Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) and web services that encapsulate business logic.
   - The J2EE application server hosts the middle-tier components, managing requests from the client tier and handling data persistence.

3. **Enterprise Data Tier**:
   - This tier focuses on data storage, typically using relational databases.
   - It supports components and services for data management, including EJBs that execute server-side business logic.

### J2EE Container-Centric Architecture

J2EE is a container-centric architecture, where containers serve as intermediaries between components and platform-specific functionalities. Key functions of containers include:

- **Management of Component Lifecycle**: Handles the lifecycle of Servlets, EJBs, and other components.
- **Configuration Services**: Customizable settings for security, transaction management, and resource lookups.
- **Non-Configurable Services**: Includes lifecycle management, database connections, and pooling.

### Types of Containers

J2EE defines four primary types of containers:

1. **Applet Container**: Manages Java applets embedded in web pages.
2. **Application-Client Container (ACC)**: Manages standalone Java applications that communicate with the server.
3. **Web Container**: Hosts web applications, executing Servlets and JSPs.
4. **EJB Container**: Manages enterprise beans and handles transactions, security, and connection pooling.

### J2EE APIs

J2EE offers several APIs to facilitate various functionalities:

1. **RMI/IIOP**: Enables communication between distributed objects across different JVMs.
2. **JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface)**: Provides naming and directory services, allowing Java applications to access and manage resources.
3. **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: Facilitates database access and manipulation, supporting both two-tier and three-tier models.
4. **JavaMail API**: Supports email messaging applications, enabling efficient mail server access.
5. **JMS (Java Message Service)**: Provides messaging services for communicating between application components asynchronously.
